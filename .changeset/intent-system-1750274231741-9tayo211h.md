Add intent-based selective restoration system (resolves #4255)

Implements comprehensive intent-based system for selective restoration of Cline-created changes while preserving user edits.

Key Features:
- Intent tracking with file scope and operation details
- File change attribution (Cline vs user modifications)  
- Selective restoration of only AI-generated changes
- Rich UI with intuitive status sorting and filtering
- Production-ready error handling and validation
- TypeScript improvements with proper type safety

Core Components:
- src/core/intent/ - Intent tracking system with IntentManager
- webview-ui/src/components/intent/ - React UI components
- webview-ui/src/components/chat/FileChangeTracker.tsx - Change attribution
- Enhanced TypeScript patterns with Result types and proper error boundaries

This directly addresses GitHub issue #4255 for selective restoration capabilities.
