## ðŸ“‹ **Pull Request Template**

### **Title**
```
feat: Workspace file watcher enhancement - Fix GitHub Issue #4253
```

### **Description**
```markdown
## Problem Solved
Resolves the issue where files from `git clone` operations aren't immediately visible in Cline's "VSCode Visible Files" list, requiring artificial `write_to_file` operations to trigger file detection.

## Solution Overview
- **Smart Command Detection**: Recognizes 20+ file-creation command patterns
- **Enhanced Workspace Refresh**: Immediate file detection with user feedback
- **External File Monitoring**: Periodic scanning and focus-triggered updates
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced operations, minimal resource impact

## Technical Implementation
- Added `isFileCreationCommand()` method for intelligent command recognition
- Enhanced `WorkspaceTracker` with `forceRefresh()` and periodic scanning
- Window focus detection for immediate external file updates
- Comprehensive error handling for network drives and permissions

## Files Modified
- `src/core/task/index.ts`: Enhanced command execution with intelligent refresh
- `src/integrations/workspace/WorkspaceTracker.ts`: Added external file detection

## Testing
- âœ… Immediate git clone file detection verified
- âœ… External file monitoring tested
- âœ… Performance impact minimal
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility confirmed
- âœ… Network drive support validated

## Backward Compatibility
- âœ… No breaking changes
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… Performance optimizations included

Closes #4253
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details for Maintainers**

### **Core Changes Summary**
1. **Command Detection**: Regex-based pattern matching for file-creation commands
2. **Intelligent Refresh**: Conditional workspace refresh based on command type
3. **External Monitoring**: Periodic scanning with debouncing and focus detection
4. **User Experience**: Progress indicators and professional feedback

### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Scan Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Debounce Delay**: 2 seconds
- **File Limit**: 1,000 files per scan
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal (Set-based tracking)
- **CPU Impact**: Low (debounced operations)

### **Error Handling**
- Network drive timeouts and retries
- Permission issue graceful handling
- Large repository optimization
- Thread-safe implementation

## ðŸ“š **Documentation Included**
